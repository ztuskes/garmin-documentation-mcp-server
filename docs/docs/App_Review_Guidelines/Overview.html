Connect IQ is a strategic commitment for Garmin enabling you to bring your innovations to life through our mutual users, diverse device portfolio &amp; powerful metrics. We’re glad you want to develop Connect IQ apps, and we want you to be successful.</p><p class="p">To help you create apps that best serve our users, we created these Connect IQ App Developer Guidelines (these “<strong class="ph b">Guidelines</strong>”). These Guidelines apply to any development or creation using the Connect IQ SDK, such as device apps, widgets, watch faces, custom data fields, and audio content provider apps. For ease of reference, we use the term “app” to cover all of these categories.</p><p class="p">These Guidelines are not an exhaustive set of rules. It may be necessary for us to suspend or remove a potentially harmful app from the Connect IQ store, even if there is no specific violation of the Guidelines. In other words, by providing you with these Guidelines, we do not waive any of our rights under applicable law or the <a class="xref" href="https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/sdks/agreement.html" target="_blank">Connect IQ Developer Agreement</a> (which you should  review).</p></div><article class="topic nested1" aria-labelledby="ariaid-title2" id="summary"><h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title2">Summary</h2><div class="body"><p class="p">We encourage you to read the entire Guidelines, but here is a summary of the main points:</p><ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Appropriate Content and Subject Matter.</strong> You are responsible for your app. We may reject or remove an app for any content or subject matter we believe is dangerous, offensive, inappropriate or unlawful. You should also be aware that certain types of apps, such as aviation apps, medical apps, or apps that support user-generated content, may be allowed only if you comply with additional requirements.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Performance Requirements.</strong> We want our users to have the best experience. If your app doesn’t function, diminishes battery life or other features of the Garmin device, or crashes frequently, it may be rejected or removed.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Promoting and Monetizing Your App.</strong> The user experience begins with how you promote, describe, and monetize your app. You must do so in a manner that is honest and fair to users and other apps</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Respecting the Rights of Others.</strong>  Do not use copyrighted content or other intellectual property of others without their permission. Your app cannot use data in a way that violates the <a class="xref" href="https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/sdks/agreement.html" target="_blank">Connect IQ Developer Agreement</a> or privacy laws.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Enforcement.</strong> We expect our developers to comply, and we reserve the right to take steps to protect our users if these Guidelines are not followed.</p></li></ol><p class="p">The remainder of these Guidelines provide additional details for these five topics.</p></div></article><article class="topic nested1" aria-labelledby="ariaid-title3" id="detailed-guidelines"><h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title3">Detailed Guidelines</h2><div class="body"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">1.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">Appropriate Content and Subject Matter</strong></p><p class="p">You are ultimately responsible for your app. This includes your app’s software and content, your app’s description in the Connect IQ store, the behavior of your app’s users, and compliance with laws, regulations, and contracts. These Guidelines describe potential issues with content and subject matter that ask you to avoid.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">a.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">Prohibited Content</strong></p><p class="p">Your app should not include content that is unlawful, harmful, obscene, inappropriate, or offensive. We prohibit apps from including, linking to, or encouraging the creation of the following types of content:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Sexual or obscene content: Including pornography, any content or services intended to be sexually gratifying, any content relating to bestiality or non-consensual sex, or explicit descriptions or displays or sexual organs or activities.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Bullying, harassment, and abuse;</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Profanity or defamatory, fraudulent, infringing, or other unlawful content;</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Spam or advertising-focused content that serves primarily to drive affiliate traffic to a website; or that has the primary purpose of serving ads;</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Gambling;</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Any other inappropriate or offensive Content: We reserve the right to reject or remove any app that, in our opinion, creates any risk of liability to Garmin, threatens any type of harm to our users or third parties, or could harm our reputation. This includes, but is not limited to, any content that directly or indirectly violates other of our terms or guidelines.</p></li></ul><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">b.</strong>   <strong class="ph b">Physical Safety</strong></p><p class="p">Your app must not threaten the physical safety or well-being of users or anyone else. We reserve the right to reject any app that we believe is unsafe or could, directly or indirectly, cause anyone harm. This includes apps that may create a false sense of security, such as “safety awareness” apps.</p><p class="p">Here are some specific issues to avoid:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Harmful Challenges:</strong> Your app should not encourage or challenge users to act or use devices in a manner that risks physical harm to themselves or others. For example, apps should not challenge users to perform exercises or activities in a manner likely to result in injury or to drink excessive amounts of alcohol.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Dangerous Activities:</strong> We prohibit apps that are designed to be used during dangerous activities such as scuba diving, free diving, skydiving, base-jumping, and extreme flight sports, even if your app is designed to work with one of Garmin’s products that has been designed for those activities. For example, you may create apps that add functionality to a Garmin Descent series dive watch, but your app should not be intended only for use <em class="ph i">during</em> a user’s dive.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Violence:</strong> We do not allow apps to facilitate or encourage gratuitous violence, human rights violations, domestic violence, child or animal abuse, or similar actions that harm the user or others.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Drugs and Dangerous Products:</strong> Apps should not promote the use of illegal drugs, tobacco or vape products, excessive amounts of alcohol, unapproved substances, and illegal or dangerous products.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Certain Aviation Use Cases:</strong> We will allow appropriate aviation-themed apps, but in addition to any other legally required disclaimers, aviation apps (except watch faces) must include the following disclaimer: “WARNING: The app is intended only as an in-flight aid and should not be used as a primary information source. If the app contains a barometric altimeter, it will not function in a pressurized aircraft and should not be used in a pressurized aircraft.”</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Regulated Activities</strong>: You are solely responsible for ensuring that your app complies with laws and regulations and includes any legally-required disclaimer. We encourage you to seek independent legal advice where appropriate, especially if your app relates to regulated activities, including the practice of medicine, law, or financial services.</p></li></ul><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">c.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">Medical Apps</strong></p><p class="p">If your app is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease or other conditions, you must be prepared to submit documentation from any relevant regulatory agencies proving the app is cleared for use in your target markets. Otherwise, you must update the app’s description, features and functionality to ensure it does not indicate any use for the purposes of diagnosis, cure, prevention, mitigation or treatment of disease or other conditions and is intended for informational purposes only. Even if your app has been cleared by a regulatory agency, we reserve the right to accept or reject the app based on these Guidelines.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">d.</strong>   <strong class="ph b">No Malware or Harmful Apps</strong></p><p class="p">We do not allow any apps that introduce or exploit security vulnerabilities. This includes, but is not limited to, apps that contain or enable any malicious software, including viruses, spyware, disabling code, or other software designed to damage a device or server or violate the privacy of our users. You are responsible for screening your apps for malicious software prior to submitting.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">e.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">No Mining for Cryptocurrency</strong></p><p class="p">We prohibit apps from using Garmin devices to mine for cryptocurrency.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">f.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">No Apps for Children under 13</strong></p><p class="p">We prohibit apps that are designed to be used by children under the age of 13.  This prohibition does not apply to any general audience apps, unless you are aware that the app is used by children under the age of 13.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">g.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">User-Generated Content</strong></p><p class="p">If you offer features that allow the publication of user-generated content to the general public or other users in your app, you are responsible for moderating the content, as necessary, to prevent any unlawful, infringing or inappropriate content. “User-generated content” includes text, images, sound, or other data submitted or uploaded by users or third parties.</p><p class="p">You must:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Have an agreement with end users that prohibits unlawful, harmful, obscene, inappropriate, or offensive content (see 1(b) – Prohibited Content, above);</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Maintain a method for users to report any inappropriate or prohibited content; and</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Publish a DMCA-compliant policy to remove content that infringes the intellectual property rights of third parties.</p></li></ul><p class="p">If you fail to moderate your app’s user-generated content, we reserve the right to take action to suspend or remove your app – just as if your own content violated these Guidelines.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">2.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">Performance Requirements</strong></p><p class="p">Our users expect a high-quality experience when using Garmin products. These Guidelines are intended to help ensure that apps perform to our users’ expectations.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">a.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">Do Not Harm the Garmin Experience</strong></p><p class="p">Your app should do no harm. Apps must not interfere with the use or enjoyment of other apps or features, such as the activity experience, battery life, device performance, etc.</p><p class="p">Here are some specific issues to avoid:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Interfering with Other Features.</strong> We do not allow apps that damage, disrupt or access in an unauthorized manner the user’s Garmin device, other devices or computers, networks, servers, application programming interfaces (APIs), or services. The app should not require changes to system settings that will adversely affect the performance of other features on the device (e.g., requiring users to disconnect a Garmin device from a paired compatible smartphone).</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Drain on Battery Life.</strong> Apps should not cause Garmin’s products to no longer meet their expected battery life, cause other apps to run more slowly, attempt to access data in an unauthorized manner, or otherwise disrupt the advertised or desired user experience.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Overriding the User’s Data</strong>. We do not allow apps to override information previously synced to their Connect account, where such data fields typically come from the Garmin device itself (e.g., speed or distance).  We want to maintain the integrity and reliability of data values collected or generated by Garmin’s devices and software.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Features Likely to Harm the Device</strong>. Apps should not require or encourage the use of a Garmin device in a manner likely to harm the device. For example, the app should not be designed for use during activities that will expose the device to harmful levels of heat or water pressure.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Test Before Submitting</strong>. By the time you submit, your app should be fully completed, tested, and ready for use. You should ensure that your app provides a stable, engaging, and responsive user experience. The app should not contain any broken links or functionality.</p></li></ul><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">b.</strong>   <strong class="ph b">Support</strong></p><p class="p">We are not responsible for providing customer support for your app or fielding complaints. You should clearly explain to users your support policy and availability. It is your responsibility to follow through on whatever support commitments you make.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">3.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">Respect the Rights of Others, including IP and Privacy Rights</strong></p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">a.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">No Infringement</strong></p><p class="p">You may not infringe any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or any other form of intellectual property (“<strong class="ph b">IP”</strong>). You must own or have a license to use all IP included in or used by your app. This includes your app’s software and content (other than user generated content, discussed below), your developer account name, as well as the logos, images, and content that you use to promote your app in the Connect IQ store.</p><p class="p">It is your responsibility to ensure IP compliance and non-infringement. Here are some tips (not legal advice):</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Obtain legal advice:</strong> If you are unsure if your use of IP is infringing, check with a lawyer. It is not for us to decide whether your use of a third party’s IP may be infringing, properly used under a license, or fair use.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Get permission:</strong> It is your responsibility to get permission as necessary from the IP owner before using their materials. Get permission in writing, keep a record of the permission, and make sure you’re complying with any terms and conditions.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Be careful using brand names and logos:</strong> Your app may be the perfect complement for someone else’s product or brand. That doesn’t mean you have a right to use their intellectual property. Be careful before making any mention of a brand or using any logo or name that is not yours.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Ask the IP owner:</strong> If you have questions about someone’s IP, you should ask the IP owner, not us (unless it is Garmin’s IP).</p></li></ul><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">b.</strong>   <strong class="ph b">Garmin’s DMCA Policy</strong></p><p class="p">Garmin maintains a DMCA policy for IP owners to notify Garmin of alleged infringement. In some situations, we may need to remove or suspend your app in accordance with our policy. You can find the policy and additional details in our <a class="xref" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/legal/terms-of-use/" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>.</p><p class="p">Garmin’s DMCA Policy is not a substitute for maintaining your own policy for moderating user-generated content. However, in some cases, we may need take action against your app as the result of infringing user-generated content.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">c.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">Privacy and Data Use</strong></p><p class="p">If your app collects and processes any user data, including any personal data, you must comply with privacy laws and any other applicable laws and regulations, as well as all privacy requirements stated in the <a class="xref" href="https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/sdks/agreement.html" target="_blank">Connect IQ Developer Agreement</a>.</p><p class="p">Here are some general considerations to keep in mind (not legal advice):</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Data Minimization:</strong> Think carefully before collecting and using personal data. It is a best practice (and often a required practice) that you take all steps to minimize the collection, processing, and retention of personal data as much as possible.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Notice:</strong> Publish and make available your own privacy policy or other notice concerning your processing of personal data and how users may contact you to exercise any of their privacy rights. You cannot rely on Garmin’s privacy policies, which only describe <em class="ph i">Garmin’s privacy practices.</em></p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Permissions:</strong> Where appropriate, seek permission from users prior to collecting location data or data that may be considered sensitive. After obtaining permission, use the data only in accordance with that permission. You are responsible for complying with any legal obligations to obtain consent, even if doing so would require you to take steps outside of the Connect IQ framework for your particular use case.</p></li></ul><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">4.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">Promoting and Monetizing Your App</strong></p><p class="p">We want users to download, install, and use your app. Promoting your app starts with a strong description in the Connect IQ store but can also include advertising the app in your own channels. We expect you to advertise in a fair, lawful and transparent manner.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">a.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">Describe Your App Accurately and Completely</strong></p><p class="p">You must not make any inaccurate or misleading statements. The information you provide about your app when submitting it to the app store should include a complete description of all features and any minimum requirements, limitations, or dependencies. This also applies to any other advertising you for your app, whether or not on a Garmin digital property, and any content or metadata associated with your app.</p><p class="p">Specifically, you must:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Use your or your company’s real name or an alias that does not impersonate another person or company;</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Keep your contact information up-to-date;</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Avoid claiming any partnership or affiliation with Garmin, unless we have given you express written permission;</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Do not claim your app is compatible with any third-party system or protocol, if you have not obtained any required certification necessary to support such compatibility claim; and</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Identify whether your app requires any specific Garmin or third-party hardware or software to operate. For example, if the app’s core features do not work without ANT+, you must disclose that. If a specific feature has a dependency, you must disclose that dependency when advertising that the specific feature.</p></li></ul><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">b.</strong>   <strong class="ph b">Compatibility with Garmin Devices and ANT or ANT+ Communications Protocols</strong></p><p class="p">You must accurately disclose which Garmin devices support your app. Because Garmin regularly releases new products, we encourage you to keep this list up-to-date.  At minimum, you must avoid falsely claiming that your app works with a certain Garmin device.</p><p class="p">If your app supports ANT or ANT+ profiles, you must list all profiles your app supports. In addition, where applicable, your app must pass ANT+ certification.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">c.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">No Review or Rating Manipulation</strong></p><p class="p">You must not perform or encourage any action that creates deceptive reviews or manipulates your app’s rating.</p><p class="p">Specifically, you must <strong class="ph b">not</strong>:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Disguise yourself as a user to publish positive reviews of your app or negative reviews of another developer’s app;</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Pay for positive reviews, including by offering users discounts on your products in exchange for a positive review or rating – even if you disclose your material connection to the reviewer; and</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Submit a rating for your own app.</p></li></ul><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">d.</strong>   <strong class="ph b">Monetization of Your App</strong></p><p class="p">You must identify whether or not your app requires payment. An app requires payment if the user must pay to access or use any primary feature of the app (i.e., those features that are advertised in the app’s description, excluding any features that are clearly labeled optional). In contrast, an app is not considered to require payment, if the only features that require payment or subscription are optional.</p><p class="p">You must be honest when describing any payment requirements, whether optional or not. You must:</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">Disclose from the outset if your app is only free for a limited time or for a limited number of uses;</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Inform users of your refund policy or lack thereof;</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Not “bait-and-switch” users by implying that a feature is available for free, when it is not; and</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p">Obtain express consent for any auto-renewal of payments, regardless of whether required to do so by law.</p></li></ul><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">5.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">Enforcement</strong></p><p class="p">Garmin intends to enforce these Guidelines by rejecting or removing apps, if necessary to stop or prevent violations. Garmin, in its discretion, may choose to contact developers and request changes to apps, but Garmin is not required to provide notice prior to suspending or removing an app.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">a.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">Approval Process</strong></p><p class="p">When you submit an app for approval, we expect the app to be ready to meet all of our Guidelines. We endeavor to review the app and the related documentation as thoroughly and promptly as possible. Please keep in mind that even if an app is approved, we may later discover issues after the review process.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">b.</strong>   <strong class="ph b">Removal Process</strong></p><p class="p">If we find an issue with an app, whether discovered by us or brought to our attention by a user, we endeavor to provide an opportunity for the developer to resubmit with feedback. If the issue presents significant risks to Garmin or our users, we may immediately suspend the ability to download or use the app. We are under no obligation to provide you with any notice or process before taking action.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">c.</strong>    <strong class="ph b">Reservation of Rights</strong></p><p class="p">Garmin reserves all rights to take any actions necessary to protect its users, products, brand, reputation, etc. This means that even if we remove an app, we can still exercise all available legal or equitable remedies.</p><p class="p"><strong class="ph b">d.</strong>   <strong class="ph b">Contact Us</strong></p><p class="p">Despite our right to enforce these Guidelines, we hope to avoid the need to take any action. We want your app to be a success. If you have questions about Connect IQ or these Guidelines, please feel free to <a class="xref" href="https://forums.garmin.com/developer/connect-iq/" target="_blank">ask a question in our developer forums</a>.</p></div></article></article></main><footer role="contentinfo"><div>
